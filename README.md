A sudoku is solved correctly, if:

* Each row contains the numbers from 1 do 9 without repeating a number
* Each column contains the numbers from 1 to 9, without repeating a number
* All 3x3 subgrids contains the numbers from 1 to 9, without repeating a number

## Derivatives

Implement a program that takes a string, representing a polynomial function and returns / prints the derivative of that polynomial function.
Example: 

  f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x + 1
  
  f'(x) = 6x^2 + 3
